Your placeable objects can come in any shape, form and size. 

With Grid Builder 2 almost any combination of shape can be handled assuming the correct setup is followed upon creation of your objects.

Importing placeable objects:

1. Your object must be clean, with seperate meshes per object. Preferably grouped under a parent. An example would be if you have a turret, with 
a weapon barrel and a base. The barrel and base would be seperate objects with whatever pivots are desireable for the animation. 

2. This parent object should have its pivot centered to the entire object with Y value on the base of the object for placement. 

3. Sometimes it is easy to get confused with which way around your object is facing. If the placement of the object is weird, it is most likely 
either you have the object backwards or you need to try a different combination on the SelectObject component. 

4. This system does NOT scale objects. If your grid is set to 1 metre, and your object takes up 2 metres on the X axis, this will be reflected
visually and will NOT block the other cells taken up if you did not set them via the SelectObject inspector. Work to scale, and it will work as intended.
